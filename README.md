COVID-19 Dataset Analysis with Machine Learning
Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 datasets using various machine learning algorithms. The focus is not only on building predictive models but also on thorough data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.

Features
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and handling missing values in COVID-19 datasets.
Standardizing and normalizing data for consistency.
Encoding categorical variables for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

In-depth analysis of COVID-19 datasets through Jupyter notebooks.
Visualizations to understand trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
Geographic visualizations for regional insights.
Feature Engineering:

Creation of new features to enhance model performance.
Time-based features to capture temporal patterns.
Transformation of variables to improve model interpretability.
Machine Learning Models:

Implementation of a variety of machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to:
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Neural Networks
Model Evaluation:

Comparison of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Cross-validation techniques for robust evaluation.
Time Series Analysis:

Specialized models for time series data to predict the progression of COVID-19 over time.
Datasets
We use publicly available COVID-19 datasets, including data on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. The datasets are regularly updated to ensure the latest information is used for analysis.
